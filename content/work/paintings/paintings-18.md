## **In some Native American cultures  dream catchers are often hung over cradles as protection. At the origin of this symbol is the Spider Woman, known as Asibikaashi; she took care of the children and the people on the land and it was said that the dream catchers "caught any harm that might be in the air as a spider's web catches and holds whatever comes in contact with it."** ##

## **Acrylic on paper; 24,5 / 34 cm** ##
