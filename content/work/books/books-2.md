## LOVE GROWS AND GROWS ##



Love Grows and Grows:  A Blooming Story for an Extended Family illustrates a healthy, collaborative approach to co-parenting.  Styled as human-hybrid flowers, the characters themselves are a metaphor for growth and the evolution toward love.

The story follows young siblings Flora and Leaf as they transition into a new and unfamiliar life between two homes-one with Mom, and one with Dad and his new wife.  Their journey highlights the challenges associated with creating extended families: a child's apprehension of meeting someone new, and eventually choosing to accept and embrace this person as a part of their secular family.  With love and patience, we see a mom and a step-mom model a wonderful example of how to put their children first, working together to create a blended family with happy and confident kids.  This example of unconditional love is what empowers Flora and Leaf to embrace a new definition of a typical family and cultivate a new "normal" that benefits everyone involved.
