### <center> [Alexandra Zgondea](https://alexandra.zgondea.com/) - Illustrator & graphic designer </center>
&nbsp;

As Dejan Stojanovic said **"My feelings are too loud for words and too shy for the world that’s why I choose to paint. I open the gates of my soul, and let the colors shape an image that would otherwise be hard to describe, hoping that a glimpse of it would make someone’s day brighter in some way.”**

Alexandra Zgondea is a freelance graphic designer and illustrator from Romania. Having loved the creative visual arts since her earliest childhood, Alexandra attended Gh, Tattarescu High School of the Arts in her local town, specializing in decorative and mural painting. 

 
After high school, Alexandra attended the National University of Arts in Bucharest,the Faculty of Decorative Arts and Design  where she graduated in 2007 with a BFA in graphic design. She worked for 3 years as a designer in Bucharest before deciding to move closer to nature in Brasov, Romania 

 

She started to freelance as an illustrator and graphic designer, creating visual identities, designing marketing material, illustrations, web graphics for a variety of clients and industries and also painting, designing original artwork and custom made, hand painted objects such as wooden boxes and furniture.

 

After her son was born, in 2013 her style of art slowly shifted, as she became more focused on doing paintings and illustrations for enriching the lives of children. She has become deeply aware of the spiritual lessons of nature and how art can help teach people about the power of the natural world to improve their lives.

 

Alexandra works out of her home in Codlea, Romania, where she lives, surrounded by nature,  with her husband and son.
